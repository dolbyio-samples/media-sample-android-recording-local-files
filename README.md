# Android Audio Recording Examples

This repo contains code samples for recording audio on Android devices using the Dolby.io APIs. It includes examples of different audio recording scenarios such as recording with noise suppression and recording in stereo.

# Overview
Following the instructions of [Recording audio on Android with examples ](https://dolby.io/blog/recording-audio-on-android-with-examples/), this project will evaluate the use of MediaRecorder, MediaPlayer, AudioRecord, and AudioTrack frameworks in Java in comparison with other audio capture and playback options. 

# Requirements 
After cloning this project, open it in Android Studio to test and experiment with different configurations. You'll likely need a physical device, as the emulator can't record audio.

# Getting Started 
As part of enabling Dolby.io's audio processing capabilities, you would need to sign up for a [Dolby.io account](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup/) You receive 50GBs to start out for free, which should help you get started with this project. 

Make sure you have your [API key ready](https://dolby.io/developers/media-processing/quick-start/analyzing-media#1-get-your-api-key) and Android Studio installed on your computer. This project will also require a physical Android device or an emulator to run the app.
